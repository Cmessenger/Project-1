<h1 style="color:teal;">I aspire to be a Special Agent
  in the FBI for my career</h1>
<p> I do not have any previous experience with coding,
  I have watched my Dad code a few times but was never
  really interested in it until I thought about being
  in the FBI and how useful it could be to know how
  to code. The Special Agent I am in contact with also
  said that he believes everyone should know how
  to code and if I h ad the chance to do it</p>
